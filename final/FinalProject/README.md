# Pokemon Game TUI

This program is part of a larger program, a Pokemon game that I made during Programming with functions. I made this to fill a need that I hadn't quite worked out yetâ€“how to make a graphical user interface without relying on any other software. Naturally, I wanted to use what I already knew how to do. I know how to write to and manipulate the vscode terminal, so a terminal user interface (TUI) was the obvious solution.  
This was a very challenging project, and you can see very clearly how far I've come by checking out my attempts at TUIs in my Pokemon-Game folder.   
There's still a long way to go. The battle mechanics have bugs, and the stats are off. The inventory has very limited functionality. I want to be able to go inside buildings and visit multiple towns. I want to improve the look of buildings and maybe even add motion to the environment.   
Unfortunately, I spent half of my time working out the basic map you see when you start the game, and the other half figuring out how to bridge the gap between C# and Python. Hours and hours fixing bug after bug, but I'm still pretty proud of what I've accomplished so far. I know that I will revisit this project soon, I can't seem to leave it alone!  

## To use this program:

Use the arrow keys to move. Walking in the grass (which looks like green periods . ) can trigger an encounter with a pokemon. For now, this means that two players get to choose a pokemon and that pokemon's level, and then battle it out until the stronger pokemon wins. So far, you can only choose pokemon from the first generation (Pokemon Red/Blue). Also, moves with zero attack power are currently excluded, so there might be some pokemon with no attacks. I plan to fix all this in the future.

## How this meets and exceeds requirements:
